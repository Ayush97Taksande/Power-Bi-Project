The project focuses on providing actionable insights through dynamic visualizations, enabling organizations to identify patterns and make informed decisions to reduce attrition.

- **User-Friendly Design**: The dashboard is intuitive and easy to navigate, ensuring accessibility for HR professionals and stakeholders.

## Tools Used
- **Power BI**: For data cleaning, modeling, and creating visualizations.
- **Excel/CSV**: For raw dataset preparation.
